**DNA to Protein Translation Script**
This Python script generates random DNA sequences, translates them to protein sequences based on the standard genetic code, and saves them in a FASTA file format. The code prints each DNA sequence along with its translated protein sequence to the console and writes these sequences to a .fasta file in the current working directory.


**Features**
- Generates 10 random DNA sequences, each 200 base pairs long.
- Translates each DNA sequence into a protein sequence using the standard genetic code.
- Handles stop codons by terminating the translation.
- Saves both DNA and protein sequences to a .fasta file and prints them to the console.

**Requirements**
This script only requires Python and does not need any external packages.
